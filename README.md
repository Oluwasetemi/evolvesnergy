I want to develop a Press Release distribution website where users can distribute press releases or run Adverts on as many blogs as possible from one site. 

### Site and Blog list
(we are currently building our site list).

### Difference compared to other existing **Press Release Website**
Unlike other PR sites, blogs / websites can determine their pricing and can track services from the ‘newsroom’.

### How it works

·Users sign up/ log in
·Click on [PRESS RELEASE] or [ADVERTS]
·Click on country Location, (we currently have sites in the UK(220), US(130+), Ghana and Nigeria and will be expanding soon)
·Click on type of blog/ website (general, lifestyle, fashion, tech, industry, agriculture, food, arts etc).
·From a drop down list, they can then pick the blogs/ site they want
Filters include (site hits, price range, social media push)
·They then set a date and time for release
·Enter the text and pictures of the press release or adverts
·A total amount they need to pay calculated based on sites they choose will show up.
(Some sites have different ad rates based on location of adverts, pop-ups to adjust those will show up)

#### Features for Bloggers and Websites

A back end (newsroom) to see how many Ads that are being run via your site only. All the blogs/ site are in your category.
Network with other bloggers to confirm news stories and breaking news, etc.
Ability to set and adjust how much users can pay for Ads and press releases.
Set coupon codes for discounts (coupon codes and discounts are announced on our home pages)
See how much money made, cash immediately.
Total number of Ads that are run through the website.
An infographic of averages- Ad types, site types with most ads/press release done (we cannot give details on the individual sites unless the blogger open details to public)
Email and text notifications (and reminders) of the press release and adverts release dates and time.
etc
Our newsroom feature will also have eye witness accounts on news updates and news reports.

> We are to adverts or press releases as Dealdey is to e-commerce, and Jovago (or hotelsng) is to hotel booking, not only do we want to make it easier for users to send out adverts and distribute press releases, we also want to be able to offer the best prices. Our key is Volume, in numbers.
